    description: "Private Home in Paris",
    fullDescription: "In one of the two private mansions, the idea was to transform the ballroom into a pied-à-terre for an international couple: my husband and myself, having left Paris to set up my agency in Dubai, from where I carry out my projects (United Arab Emirates, France, Switzerland and London).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In keeping with the building's heritage, we designed a 90 m² loft for ourselves, conceived as a luxury hotel suite in the heart of Paris.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Our brief was to create a warm, friendly, contemporary space whose elegance would convey the French art of living. A place capable of welcoming our families, friends and clients, when we are in Paris.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "How could we create cohesion, well-being and ergonomics in a single space, while at the same time creating an intimacy specific to each of our couple's functions and rhythms?\n" +
        "I based the craftsmanship of this project on noble materials such as wood, marble, brass, glass and metalwork. American walnut, Mont Blanc marble and Brazilian quartzite create a particularly warm and elegant atmosphere.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A palette of shades from powder pink to black, deep greens, midnight blue and soft gold form the backdrop to the fine selection of furniture sourced from Minotti, Poltrona Frau and Walter Knoll. The kitchen was made to measure by Polyform.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The 4.50-metre-high ceiling, from which curtains by Baumann flow, is crowned by two Nemo chandeliers that add to the initial nobility of the space.\n" +
        "The herringbone parquet floor, with its hammered brass medallions screwed in like clockwork, incorporates the heating system. Eliminating this way the need for any wall-mounted appliances.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The aerial perspective from the mezzanine, housing the bedroom, offers a remarkable vista of the array of chandeliers and the flooring, which seemingly extends into the period mirror positioned above a grand fireplace, its hearth re-clad in enamelled lava to reflect the flames during winter.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In the mineral bathroom, light grey marble, named for its Mont Blanc trace, forms the bespoke bevelled drawers that constitute the washbasin unit and adorn the floor and walls of an expansive walk-in shower.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "A distinct guest bedroom has been established, presenting a challenge for this 15 m² room on the mezzanine level. A substantial partition of etched, illuminated glass divides the bedroom from the bathroom, maximising the sense of space and natural light. Illumination arrangements enhance the intimacy of this Parisian boudoir.",
